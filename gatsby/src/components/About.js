          My name is Patrick and I am a web developer. If Iâ€™m not at my home in
          San Diego youâ€™ll find me on my sailboat somewhere in the world. Iâ€™ve
          been involved in technology and programming for 20+ years in various
          roles. I've been focused on software and web developementfor the past
          5 years.

          ), styling components using Styled Components and SASS, and
          occasionally using Frameworks just as Bootstrap or Material Design.

          These days you're going to find me digging deep into modern web
          databases such as MongoDB and PostgresSQL, and backend frameworks like
          NodeJS and Express Server to round out my ability to operate as a
          full-stack developer.
